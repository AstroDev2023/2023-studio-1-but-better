This game was developed in just 8 weeks, with work being broken up into 4 different 2-week long sprints. The goals for each sprint were as follows:

- Sprint 1 - Minimum Viable Product
- Sprint 2 - Core Game Functionality
- Sprint 3 - Full Game Delivery
- Sprint 4 - Polished Game

To better manage these sprints and the features introduced in them, students documented their work in this GitHub repository through pull requests and issues.
