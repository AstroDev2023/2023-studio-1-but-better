# UQ 2023 Studio 1 - Gardens of the Galaxy

## Welcome

Gardens of the Galaxy is a futuristic space farming game created by the students of Studio 1 for CSSE3200. With other 40 students split up into 8 different teams working on this game, it has been transformed from a barebones game-engine to a fully fledged space farming game, with limitless potential.

This version of the game has a subset of the original devs working on improving the game. The original can be found [here](https://github.com/UQcsse3200/2023-studio-1).

## Game Engine Description

This game engine was developed to support studio-based project courses at the [University of Queensland](https://uq.edu.au/ "UQ Home Page"). It provides a fun environment in which students can develop a real game over the duration of the semester. It is based on the [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/ "libGDX Information") framework and is developed in Java. 

You are welcome to use the game engine for your own purposes. It is released under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT "MIT License Description"). Acknowledgment of the source of the game engine is required.
